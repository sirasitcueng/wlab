    description: "We explore advanced ways to control how light and matter interact at extremely small scales, aiming to develop next-generation technologies for quantum photonics. On one side, we design and build tiny metal structures that can guide and amplify light in unique ways, helping us detect very small signals—like single molecules—and even control their behavior by placing them precisely between special structures. These systems are designed to keep their quantum properties stable, even at room temperature, by carefully shaping where and how the light is focused. On the other side, we use artificial intelligence to reverse-engineer the best designs by focusing on how much light energy is available for a quantum emitter, like an atom or molecule, to interact with. Altogether, these approaches help us create smarter, more efficient devices that could power future technologies in sensing, communication, and quantum computing.",

    description: "We use a powerful simulation method called Particle-in-Cell (PIC), originally from plasma physics, to better understand how electrons behave in tiny structures important for future optical and quantum technologies. Unlike traditional methods that only look at electromagnetic fields, PIC simulates both the fields and the motion of electrons, helping us capture complex effects like how electrons spill out of metals or lose energy. We’ve applied this to materials like graphene, discovering new ways to convert low-frequency light into higher frequencies more efficiently by directing electron flow in specially designed structures. This could lead to better devices for detecting and controlling light in the infrared and terahertz ranges. Looking ahead, we’re working to adapt PIC to explore the fast, quantum-level behavior of electrons in solids, opening the door to smarter, tunable technologies for light-based electronics and quantum plasmonics.",

    description: "This research explores how fast-moving free electrons interact with different kinds of light-controlling materials to uncover new physical effects that go beyond well-known radiation types like Cherenkov and Smith–Purcell radiation. We're not just trying to make these light emissions stronger—we also want to control their direction, spin, and other properties by designing special materials, even ones that change over time. In steady materials, we use advanced design tools to shape how electrons release light, and in time-changing materials, we discover entirely new behaviors where momentum, not energy, dictates what happens. We're building experimental systems, like engineered surfaces and plasma setups, to test these ideas. This work could lead to new technologies in light sources, particle acceleration, and high-speed optics.",
